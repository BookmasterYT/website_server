            <h1 class="sectionTitle">Foreword</h1>
            <p id="Foreword" class="whiteFont">George Chandler first and foremost stands with and for the Consitution of Struklantis 
                <em>and</em> all of its Amendments. You can read the whole Constitution of Struklantis linked
                <a href="/resources/constitution">here</a>. All of Mr. Chandler's policies are based on the underlying
                motive of punishing wrongdoing and enhancing righteousness among all citizens, including the government.
                <br><br>
                Chandler has also taken a survey about the controversial topic of taking off shoes in-class. It has
                concluded with the idea that shoes off is <em>okay</em>! However, socks <em>MUST</em> be worn at all times,
                to make sure the aroma of the classroom stays in top form.
            </p>
            <h1 class="sectionTitle">Policies</h1>
            <ol class="whiteFont">
                <li><h2><strong>Seating Chart</strong></h2></li>
                <h3 class="whiteFont">After taking a survey of the citizens of Struklantis, Chandler has been inspired
                    to devise a brand new seating arrangement to make class more fun and engaging. Often you may come into
                    class and met with a random table arrangement (policy not yet approved by Mrs. Struk). There may even be
                    theme days (sit with someone with the same shoe color, sit with someone your same height, etc.).
                    <br><br>
                    Also, above all, citizen input will overcome any decision of the seating chart made by Chandler and 
                    House. 
                </h3>
                <li><h2><strong>Social Credit System</strong></h2></li>
                <h3 class="whiteFont">The Chandler administration is creating a revolutionary new way to ensure 
                    that negative behavior is discouraged and good behavior is encouraged. It is a drawn up plan
                    of an unbiased, equal social credit system which is completely unqiue to this administration. 
                    <br><br>
                    The social credit is called Fluid Ounces (or Floz for short). The more Floz you have, 
                    the more privileges you will earn. The less Floz you have, the fewer privileges you will have.
                    For example, if you are an exceptional student and have over 30 Floz, you can go get water and use 
                    the restroom without permission. If you are a distruptive student and have negative Floz, your
                    bathroom and water privileges will be heavily restricted. 
                    <br><br>
                    How will you, a citizen of Struklantis, be awarded Floz? As mentioned before, you will gain it for 
                    good behavior. However, there are other ways you can earn Floz. There will be a weekly riddle on the
                    whiteboard. If you solve it correctly, you will be awarded Floz. There will be a celebration of a single
                    citizen every day, and that special citizen (among other benefits) will receive Floz as a gift!
                    <br><br>
                    There will be a special Lottery that you can spend Floz to earn <em>more</em> Floz!
                </h3>
                <li><h2><strong>Feedback Box</strong></h2></li>
                <h3 class="whiteFont">Another revolutionary way the Chandler administration is getting closer to the citizens
                    is through "Fred the Feedback Box". You can drop your feedback, concerns, needs, and desires for change in
                    Fred and the Department of Communication (created by Chandler) will look them over and communicate them to
                    the presidency.</h3>
                <li><h2><strong>National Struklantis Day</strong></h2></li>
                <h3 class="whiteFont">Along with daily celebrations of each and every citizen of Struklantis, once a week will be 
                    an anniversary celebration of the founding of Struklantis. The celebration will be catered by the very own Head
                    of Cooking (which will be appointed if Chandler is voted in by the wonderful citizens).
                </h3>
